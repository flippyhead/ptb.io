![The ShareWall at Tougo Coffee](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/242501/yeahtotally.org/sharewall-1.JPG)

ShareWall is a small experiment in community sharing (and building real-time apps using [Meteor](http://meteor.com/)).

My favorite coffee shop, [Tougo Coffee](http://tougocoffee.com/), installed a large HD flat panel screen. Displayed is a rotating collection of community uploaded images. Coffee drinkers can visit a mobile-friendly page to post images or messages to the screen.

You can see [what's on the screen currently](http://sharewall.co/wall).
