  Hi, I'm Peter T. Brown, a technology entrepreneur, artist and intellectual. I started out in college studying Japanese and computer science but that was in the late 90's and hey, the opportunity seemed unique, so I dropped out and started a series of technology companies. Some did better than others; mostly the best are yet to come.
</p>

<p>
  I'm currently the CTO and co-founder of <a href="http://pathable.com">Pathable, Inc.</a>, where we make conferences better for organizers and attendees. Some friends and I developed a large scale <a href="/heaid">interactive musical instrument</a> for Burning Man. I made a <a href="/mebe">small tool</a> to help one talk in pictures, and a <a href="/sharewall">experiment in community sharing</a>. I've also released a number of <a href="https://github.com/flippyhead?tab=repositories">open source projects</a> generally related to JavaScript and Ruby programming. Most recently I created the <a href="https://github.com/flippyhead/admiral">admiral library</a> for managing Meteor projects on AWS EC2.
</p>

<p>
  You can find me partially engaged on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/flippyhead">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/flippyhead">Twitter</a>. I've got a few places listed on <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/1635606">AirBnb</a> too. Feel free to email me. I'm p at ptb dot io.
